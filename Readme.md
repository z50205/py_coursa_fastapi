This is a simple course selection system demo built with the FastAPI framework. The application includes three primary data models: User, Course, and CourseUser, representing users, available courses, and enrollment relationships respectively.

The system is containerized using Docker Compose and deployed on an AWS EC2 instance for ease of scalability and management. Additionally, a valid SSL certificate has been obtained, and the service is accessible via the secure domain:

This demo serves as a foundation for building a more comprehensive course management platform, supporting user registration, course creation, and enrollment functionalities.
